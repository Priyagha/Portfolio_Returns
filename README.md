# Analysing Portfolio Returns

This project focuses on analyzing portfolio returns using Fama-French factors, comparing two distinct investment strategies: monthly investments throughout the year and investments excluding summer months. The analysis employs a Monte Carlo simulation to assess robustness over randomly selected 30-year investment periods. Key performance metrics, including Time-weighted rate of return and Sharpe ratio, are calculated to offer insights into the risk-adjusted portfolio performance.
